# Vacation Budget Tracker App

The goal of this project is to build a simple Python app that helps users track and categorize their vacation expenses. I created this as a personal project to manage and stay within my vacation budget.

# The App Runs in the Terminal and Allows Users to:
- Enter an expense name, category and amount
- Save each entry to a .csv file
- Read and summarize all recorded expenses
- Calculate how much of the total vacation budget remains
